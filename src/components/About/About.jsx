        <hr />
        Over the last decade, the Prestige Group has firmly established itself
        as one of the leading and most successful developers of real estate in
        India by imprinting its indelible mark across all asset classes. Founded
        in 1986, the group's turnover is today in excess of Rs. 3518 Cr(for FY
        15) a leap that has been inspired by CMD Irfan Razack and marshalled by
        his brothers Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack. Having completed 210 projects 
        covering over 80 million sq. ft., currently the company has 53 ongoing 
        projects spanning 54 million sq. ft., and 35 upcoming projects aggregating 
        48 million sq. ft. of world-class real estate space across asset classes.
